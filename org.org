* Idea
** Problem
Public buildings and student housing waste energy on heating, lighting, and ventilation for empty rooms. Decisions are made without insight into actual usage patterns. Sensors can collect real-time data (temperature, occupancy, air quality, power consumption), but the challenge is turning this data into actionable information for users (staff, students, residents) without feeling intrusive or confusing.

*Task*: Build a system that shows where energy is wasted, suggests actions, or auto-adjusts settings—while remaining user-friendly and non-invasive.

** Solution
*FlowMetrics*
Heatmap system showing where and how the different metrics behave over time,
visualizing and emphasise where and how the metrics are worse. Maybe create a
suggestion system.

Automatically adjust metrics;
*** Example:
Someone left a window open in a room
*Symptoms:*
- Heating requires more power compared to usual (outside, historical, others)
- Air quality rises naturally (hopefully)
*Action:*
- Reduce power to heating, start listening to temperature. If starting to rise
  again -> normal power (window closed)
- Reduce ventilation if air quality seems good, window takes care of the rest.

*** How it looks:

**** Dashboard:


**** Map:

A heatmap inspired visualization for the different metrics. Used to analyze
where losses happen, and how the whole system (building) works in unison

** Why it matters
Increases:
- Observability
- Prioritization

Decreases:
- Cost
- Environmental stuff


* Tech Stack
- Python 3.14
  - [[https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/][FastAPI]]
- Web
  - Deck.gl [[https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/tree/9.2-release/examples/website/screen-grid][Grid]]

* Architecture
** Feature Spec
- [ ] Plantegning - Med etasjer
- [ ] Overvåking av metrics, og basere det på lokasjon
- [ ] Kunne plassere IoT og andre ting, og dette skal jobbe automatisk
- [ ] Hvor lekker "metrics"? Altså, lekker ett rom varme ut av bygget/inn til et
  annet rom?
- [ ] Bruke soldata (vinkel, styrke, etc.. ) i kalkuleringer [[https://www.sunearthtools.com/dp/tools/pos_sun.php?lang=en][SunEarthTools]]

** Overview

** Key Components
**** Entities:
- IoT Sensor :: Heat | Air quality | Occupancy
- Metric-improver-devices :: Power Consumption && ( Heating effect | Air quality effect and
  spreading of air )
